## Material

In this part we will set up your computer to work on the remote AWS server or with Docker (choose **Docker** if you are doing this course independently).

=== "mac OS/Linux"

    You have received an e-mail shortly before the workshop with a key, username and IP address to login on a cloud server. Before you do this part, you should have installed FileZilla and Atom.

    !!! warning "Great power comes with great responsibility"
        The cloud server is a temporary instance for this workshop only. Although the computational resources should be more than enough, **it's a basic Ubuntu server, and there are no hard limits on memory or CPU usage.**
        Take therefore into account that great power comes with great responsibility. Overloading it can result in a reboot, cancelling all running calculations.

    ### Video tutorials

    Below you can find video tutorials to set up FileZilla and atom to edit and/or transfer remote files.

    #### Atom

    Atom is a versatile text editor for all major operating systems. For this course, it's the recommended script editor for Linux and Mac OS users. With the third-party package `ftp-remote-edit`, you can remotely edit scripts. The video tutorial explains how to set it up.

    #### FileZilla

    Many results come in an image (e.g. `.png`, `.jpg`) or `html` format. These can not be viewed directly from the server. Also, for this course, files loaded in IGV need to be on your local computer. You can easily transfer files between your local PC and the remote host with [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). The video tutorial explains how to set it up.

=== "Windows"

    You have received an e-mail shortly before the workshop with a key, username and IP address to login on a cloud server. Before you do this part, you should have installed FileZilla and MobaXterm.

    !!! warning "Great power comes with great responsibility"

    ### Video tutorials

    Below you can find video tutorials to set up FileZilla, atom and MobaXterm to edit and/or transfer remote files.

    #### MobaXterm

    MobaXterm is an SSH client for Windows. Use this to connect to the remote host and edit remote scripts if you're on Windows. The video tutorial explains how to set it up.

## Exercises

### 1. First login

=== "mac OS/Linux"

    #### Login to AWS EC2 remote server

    Use the video tutorials and the information below to log in and set up a remote script editor.

    Open a terminal and login like this:

    ```sh
    ssh -i path/to/key/key_[USERNAME].pem [USERNAME]@[AWS_IP]
    ```

    !!! warning
        change `path/to/key` to the actual path where you have put the key file.

    #### Setup your favourite editor to work remotely

    To directly initiate and modify scripts on the remote server you can use the Atom plugin `ftp-remote-edit`

    In general, setup the connection to the server with the following details:

    * protocol: sftp
    * username: your username
    * hostname: server IP
    * port: 22
    * authentication/logon type: path to private key file

    Tutorials are found above in the [video tutorial to set up Atom](https://player.vimeo.com/video/473838666).

    #### Initiate conda

    To make use of the pre-installed software with conda, we need to initiate it first. Login to the server and run:

    ```sh
    /opt/miniconda3/bin/conda init
    exec bash
    ```

    To load the environment with the required software packages, run:

    ```sh
    conda activate ngs
    ```

    !!! note "Activating the environment"
        You will need to activate the ngs environment each time you login.

=== "Windows"

    #### Login to AWS EC2 remote server

    Use the video tutorials and the information below to log in and set up a remote script editor.

    If you are using MobaXterm on windows, you will automatically login to the remote server once you've started the SSH session. Follow the [video tutorial on MobaXterm](https://player.vimeo.com/video/473838657) to set up an SSH session.

    These are the general settings you should take into account:

    * protocol: sftp
    * username: your username
    * hostname: server IP
    * port: 22
    * authentication/logon type: path to private key file

    #### Initiate conda

    To make use of the pre-installed software with conda, we need to initiate it first. Login to the server and run:

    ```sh
    /opt/miniconda3/bin/conda init
    exec bash
    ```

    To load the environment with the required software packages, run:

    ```sh
    conda activate ngs
    ```

    !!! note "Activating the environment"
        You will need to activate the ngs environment each time you login.

=== "Docker"

    Docker can be used to run an entire isolated environment in a container. This means that we can run the software with all its dependencies required for this course locally in your computer. Independent of your operating system.

    Use the [video tutorial](https://player.vimeo.com/video/481620477) in combination with the commands below to set up the Docker container.

    A command to run the environment required for this course looks like this (in a terminal or powershell):

    === "Mac OS/Linux terminal"
        ```sh
        docker run \
        -v /full/path/to/local/workdir:/root/workdir \
        -i -t \
        geertvangeest/ngs-intro \
        /bin/bash
        ```

    === "Windows powershell"
        ```powershell
        docker run `
        -v C:\Users\myusername:/root/workdir `
        -i -t `
        geertvangeest/ngs-intro `
        /bin/bash
        ```

    The option `-v` mounts a local directory in your computer to the directory `/root/workdir` in the docker container. In that way, you have files available both in the container and on your computer. Use this directory on your computer to e.g. edit scripts and visualise data with IGV. Change the first path to a path on your computer that you want to use as a working directory.

    !!! note "Don't mount directly in the home dir"
        Don't directly mount your local directory to the home directory (`/root`). This will lead to unexpected behaviour.

    The options `-i` and `-t` let's you approach the container interactively. Meaning that you can use the shell.

    The last bit, `geertvangeest/ngs-intro` is the image we are going to load into the container. The image contains all the information about software and dependencies needed for this course. When you run this command for the first time it will download the image. Once it's on your computer, it will start immediately.

    You can exit the shell with `exit`.

    #### Restarting the container

    After exiting, you can restart the container.

    Find the container name:

    ```sh
    docker container ls -a
    ```

    The name is e.g. `adoring_bell`. To restart run:

    ```sh
    docker start adoring_bell
    docker attach adoring_bell
    ```

    If you have additional installations, and you want to keep them, you can save the image with:

    ```sh
    docker commit adoring_bell my-image
    ```

    #### Use conda

    If you are in the container with shell, you can load the environment with the required software packages:

    ```sh
    conda activate ngs
    ```

    !!! note "Activating the environment"
        You will need to activate the ngs environment each time you login.

### 2. A UNIX command line interface (CLI) refresher

Most bioinformatics software are UNIX based and are executed through the CLI. When working with NGS data, it is therefore convenient to improve your knowledge on UNIX. For this course, we need basic understanding of UNIX CLI, so here are some exercises to refresh your memory.

#### Make a new directory

Login to the server and use the command line to make a directory called `workdir`.

!!! note "If working with Docker"
    If your are working with docker you are a root user. This means that your "home" directory is the root directory, i.e. `/root`, and not `/home/username`. If you have mounted your local directory to `/root/workdir`, this directory should already exist.

??? done "Answer"
    ```sh
    cd
    mkdir workdir
    ```

Make a directory `scripts` within `~/workdir` and make it your current directory.

??? done "Answer"
    ```sh
    cd workdir
    mkdir scripts
    cd scripts
    ```

#### File permissions

Generate an empty script in your newly made directory `~/workdir/scripts` like this:

```sh
touch new_script.sh
```

Add a command to this script that writes "SIB courses are great!" (or something you can better relate to.. :wink:) to stdout, and try to run it.

??? done "Answer"
    You can use your remote script editor to edit your script. Otherwise you can use `nano` to edit it:

    ```sh
    nano new_script.sh
    ```

    The script should look like this:

    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    echo "SIB courses are great!"
    ```

Usually, you can run it like this:

```sh
./new_script.sh
```

But there's an error:

```
bash: ./new_script.sh: Permission denied
```

Why is there an error?

!!! hint
    Use `ls -lh new_script.sh` to check the permissions.

??? done "Answer"

    ```sh
    ls -lh new_script.sh
    ```

    gives:

    ```sh
    -rw-r--r--  1 user  group    51B Nov 11 16:21 new_script.sh
    ```

    There's no `x` in the permissions string. You should change at least the permissions of the user.

Make the script executable for yourself, and run it.

??? done "Answer"

    Change permissions:

    ```
    chmod u+x new_script.sh
    ```

    `ls -lh new_script.sh` now gives:

    ```
    -rwxr--r--  1 user  group    51B Nov 11 16:21 new_script.sh
    ```

    So it should be executable:

    ```sh
    ./new_script.sh
    ```

More on `chmod` and file permissions [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/437958/how-to-use-the-chmod-command-on-linux/).

#### Redirection: `>` and `|`

In the root directory (go there like this: `cd /`) there are a range of system directories and files. Write the names of all directories and files to a file called `system_dirs.txt` in your home directory.

??? done "Answer"
    ```sh
    ls / > ~/system_dirs.txt
    ```

The command `wc -l` counts the number of lines, and can read from stdin. Make a one-liner with a pipe `|` symbol to find out how many system directories and files there are.

??? done "Answer"
    ```sh
    ls / | wc -l
    ```

#### Variables

Store `system_dirs.txt` as variable (like this: `VAR=variable`), and use `wc -l` on that variable to count the number of lines in the file.

??? done "Answer"
    ```sh
    FILE=system_dirs.txt
    wc -l $FILE
    ```

#### shell scripts

Make a shell script that automatically counts the number of system directories and files.

??? done "Answer"
    Make a script called e.g. `current_system_dirs.sh`:
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    cd /
    ls | wc -l
    ```

### 3. Detaching a job

On this server, there is no job scheduler, so everything is run directly from the command line. That means that if a process is running, the command line will be busy, and the job will be killed upon logout. To circumvent this, there are several methods to 'detach' the screen or prevent a 'hangup signal' of a job runnig in the background that will terminate your running job.
The software `screen` or `tmux` can be used to detach your screen, and all messages to stderr or stdout (if not redirected) will be printed to the (detached) console. Use those if you're comfortable with them.

Another, more basic, program to prevent the 'hangup signal' is `nohup`. Use it like so:

```sh
nohup [YOUR COMMAND] &
```

!!! note
    Don't forget the `&` after the command. This symbol let's the process run in the background.

So, for running e.g. a shell script this would be:

```sh
nohup script.sh &
```

Anything written to stdout or stderr will be written to the file `nohup.out` in your current working directory.

!!! warning "Don't change your script while running"
    `nohup` runs through your script line-by-line and reads it from disk. If you change your script while running it, it will run the new lines.

Generate a script that waits for 120 seconds (use `sleep`) and prints `I'm done!` to stdout if it's done.

??? done "Answer"
    Script called `wait.sh`:
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    sleep 120
    echo "I'm done!"
    ```

Run this script in the background without a hangup signal (so, by using `nohup`), logout, and login again, and see if it's still running with `ps x`.

??? done "Answer"
    ```sh
    nohup wait.sh &
    ```
    Remember the PID, logout and login (within 120 seconds.. )

    ```sh
    ps x
    ```
