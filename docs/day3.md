Details on organisation and projects can be found at documentation of [day 2](day2/group_work.md).

## During the projects

* The time to do the projects is limited, so if you're stuck: **don't hesitate to ask questions**
* If you have time left, consider to add an evaluation, like:
    * The effect of varying specific arguments
    * The effect of trimming/not trimming
    * Another aligner of your choice
